As a driven and ambitious individual from Umlazi, a vibrant township in KwaZulu-Natal, I am eager to embark on a successful career in programming. At 24 years old, I have developed a passion for coding and am committed to honing my skills to become a proficient programmer.

Currently, I am enrolled in a Python certification program at (www.nextgenlearning.org.uk), which has provided me with a solid foundation in programming principles. Although I am new to the industry and do not have direct experience, I am a quick learner, and my enthusiasm for coding drives me to continuously learn and grow.

My ultimate goal is to become a professional programmer, contributing to innovative projects and collaborating with esteemed companies. I am excited about the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
